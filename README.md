## Learn Sequelize

Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM tool for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, Amazon Redshift and Snowflakeâ€™s Data Cloud. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

**Installation**:

```
npm install --save sequelize
```

**Database Creation**: To connect to the database, you must create a Sequelize instance. This can be done by either passing the connection parameters separately to the Sequelize constructor or by passing a single connection URI:

```javascript
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

// Option 1: Passing a connection URI
const sequelize = new Sequelize('sqlite::memory:') // Example for sqlite
const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname') // Example for postgres

// Option 2: Passing parameters separately (sqlite)
const sequelize = new Sequelize({
  dialect: 'sqlite',
  storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite'
});

// Option 3: Passing parameters separately (other dialects)
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: /* one of 'mysql' | 'postgres' | 'sqlite' | 'mariadb' | 'mssql' | 'db2' | 'snowflake' | 'oracle' */
});

```

Most of the methods provided by Sequelize are asynchronous and therefore return Promises. They are all Promises, so you can use the Promise API (for example, using then, catch, finally) out of the box.
Of course, using async and await works fine as well.
