## Error Handling In nodejs.

Error handling is a crucial part of any application. It is the process of catching errors and handling them in a way that prevents the application from crashing. In this article, we will discuss error handling in Node.js.

### What is an Error?

An error is an object that is thrown when an unexpected condition occurs in the application. Errors can occur due to various reasons such as invalid input, network issues, file not found, etc.

### How can we handle errors in Node.js?

There are several ways to handle errors in Node.js. Some of the common ways are:

1. Using try-catch blocks :

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error
}
```

2. Using the error-first callback pattern:

```javascript
fs.readFile("file.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    // Handle the error
  } else {
    // Process the data
  }
});
```

3. Using the Promise API:

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => {
    // Process the response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle the error
  });
```
