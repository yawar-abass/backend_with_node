## Let's Learn the MVC

    MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development. It helps to organize code and separate concerns by dividing an application into three interconnected components: the Model (Data), the View (UI), and the Controller (Business Logic).

    - **Model**: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database or other data sources, performs data manipulation, and provides the necessary data to the View and Controller.

    - **View**: The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It defines the structure and layout of the user interface. In Node.js, views are typically implemented using templating engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.

    - **Controller**: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to perform necessary operations, and updates the View accordingly.

    In a Node.js application, you can implement MVC by using frameworks like Express.js. Express.js provides a flexible routing system that allows you to define routes, handle HTTP requests, and separate the concerns of the Model, View, and Controller.

    By following the MVC pattern, you can achieve better code organization, maintainability, and reusability in your Node.js applications.
